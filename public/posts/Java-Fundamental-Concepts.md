# Java Fundamental Concepts

## About Java

**Brief History**. The java language began as a language for programming electronic devices, though the original project was never complete. Its creator was **James Gosling**, of sun microsystems. The language was develop privately starting in 1991 and was made publicly available in 1994. in 2009, Oracle bought the rights to java from Sun Microsystems.



## JDK, JRE, JVM

Think of the relationship as: **JDK > JRE > JVM**

**JDK (Java Development Kit):** The **Suitcase**. It wraps around the JRE and adds the tools needed to *write* and *compile* code (like the compiler `javac`).

**JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** The **Body**. It wraps around the JVM and adds the "libraries" (pre-written code) needed to run a program.

**JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** The **Heart**. It is the engine that actually executes the code line-by-line.
